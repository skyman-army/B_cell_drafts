\section*{Follicular Mature B cells}

We aimed to quantify the population dynamics of follicular mature (FM) B cells and to understand their rules of replacement.  We adopted the conventional view of B cell development and assumed that Transitional 2 (T2) cells are the direct precursor of FM cells. We also assumed that both FM and T2 cells circulate freely in the lymphatic system, and so we pooled the numbers of these subsets in spleen and the lymph nodes when modeling their dynamics.

%We define turnover to mean loss. 

% In the busulfan chimeras, if the source is constant in time and all cells behave the same way, the existing population is replaced at rate $\lambda$, the net loss rate (turnover rate - division rate). 

%So rate of replacement is not necessarily the rate of turnover (unless there is no division). Divison compensates for turnover and keeps host cells in the pool for longer.

%Might be worth coming up with a word for $\lambda$. I think 'clonal persistence --- low $\lambda$ means that a cell and its progeny survive for a long time (if $\lambda=0$, a clone persists for ever even though it may be dividing and dying; if $\lambda>0$, mean lifetime of a lineage (e.g. a cell and all its descendents) is $1/\lambda$. If $\lambda>0$, the cell population grows exponentially as $e^{\lambda t}$. 


\red{One concern: Sanket tried T1 as source and it actually gives better fits in all FM cases ($\Delta$AIC $\simeq$ 5). But we are going with dogma and saying T2 is source. It's puzzling to us that there is apparently so much residual Ki67 expression in FM from the T2 source, if all the division is pre-T1 as you say. Makes me worry a littl...} 

\subsection*{Replacement kinetics are consistent with FM cells being a single, kinetically homogeneous population, with cell lifetime increasing with host age}

The normalised donor fraction $f_{d}$ in the FM compartment stabilises close to 1 by about 120d post-BMT,  implying the near-complete replacement of the compartment within that timeframe. Complete replacement suggests that the average rates of loss across host and donor cell populations are always equal.

We modelled this behaviour by assuming that cells differentiate into FM B cells at a rate proportional to numbers of T2 cells, and all FM cells, whether host or donor, are lost through death or differentiation  at rate $\delta$ and renewed through division  at rate $\rho$. For generality we allowed either of these rates to vary with the age of the host. We fitted each model  simultaneously to the timecourses of the total size and donor cell chimerism of the FM population (Figure~\ref{fig:results_FM}A and B; see Methods for details). We found strongest support for a model in which the loss or turnover rate $\delta$ changes with host age and the division rate $\rho$ remains constant. Specifically, total numbers of FM B cells are given by
\be
\ddt{N_\text{FM}} = \;  \phi(t) + (\rho - \delta_{0}e^{-rt}) N_\text{FM},
\ee
where $\phi(t)$ is the daily rate of influx from T2, which changes little with host age but whose timecourse was estimated using a (nearly flat) spline,  and time is measured from age 40 days, at which time the loss rate is $\delta_{0}$. This model was superior to the simplest model with constant rates of division and turnover ($\Delta$AIC = 5.9) and also superior to the alternative with a time-varying division rate ($\Delta$AIC = 12). We estimate that FM B cells divide slowly, on average every 56 days,  and have a mean residence time (lifetime) of 18 days in 40 day-old mice. This life expectancy doubles approximately every 14 months. We also predict that approximately 4\% of FM B cells are replaced each day by newly differentiated cells from the T2 population. Parameter estimates and 95\% confidence intervals are in Table 2.

\subsection*{No evidence for  heterogeneity or cell-age dependent effects within FM B cells}

The net loss rate $\lambda$ dictates the rate of replacement of FM cells. The decline we detect in $\lambda$ with host age, which we infer derives from progressively increased survival within the FM compartment,  therefore drives  a gradual slowing of the approach to stable chimerism (Figure~\ref{fig:results_FM}B) relative to the kinetic predicted by a simple model of constant division and turnover. An alternative explanation of this time-varying kinetic is that the FM pool comprises independent subpopulations with different but constant rates of division and turnover, each fed from the T2 source.  In this scenario, less persistent populations (those with a high net loss rate $\lambda$) will be replaced most rapidly after BMT, giving an initial steep upslope in chimerism. There will then follow a slower increase as the more persistent  FM subpopulations (with low $\lambda$) are replaced by donor cells relatively slowly.

We fitted a model of kinetic heterogeneity assuming two independent subpopulations, allowing their relative size and their constant loss rates $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ to be free parameters. However this model received lower support than the model of FM cells as a single population with turnover slowing with host age ($\Delta$AIC = 12, Table \ref{tab:FM-AICs}).   Indeed there was a very weak signature of kinetic heterogeneity;  the estimated net loss rates of the two FM subpopulations  were nearly equal  ($\lambda_{1} =\delta_{1} -\rho_{1}$ = 0.039 (0.025, 0.062) and  $\lambda_{2}$ = 0.028 (0.023,0.033)) and close to that of the simplest homogeneous model with $\lambda$ = 0.029 (0.024, 0.033).

We also found no evidence for any host-donor differences in kinetics in the form of a persistent host-derived `incumbent' population, or any change in the net rate of loss of loss with cell, rather than host, age (Table~1). For a discussion of these models, see Hogan et al. PNAS 2015 and Rane et al. PLoS Biology 2018 (in press)). 

Another potential mechanism for slowing replacement with host age is a decline in the rate of influx (e.g. a fall in the rate of differentiation from T2) with host age. We found no evidence for this ($\Delta$AIC > 10), and were close to overfitting at this point.

The latter took account of different ages at BMT (right-hand panel, coloured lines; each generated using the  mode of the age within each group). (C) We then used the model parameters to predict the proportion of cells that were \khi\ within host and donor FM B cells over time.}
	\label{fig:results_FM}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{The model of time-varying loss successfully predicts the kinetics of Ki67 expression within host and donor populations}
As well as the numbers of host and donor-derived cells in the FM compartment, we  also measured the kinetics of their expression of Ki67, a nuclear protein expressed during cell cycle and lost with a lifetime of 3-4 days following mitosis (Gossel eLife 2017 \red{and others - see refs in that paper}). Immediately following BMT the donor FM cells are highly enriched for recently divided cells, with around 80\% \khi, but this proportion falls slowly to equalise with that of host cells at around 10\% after approximately 100 days (Figure~\ref{fig:results_FM}C, red and green points).

As a validation of the models,  which were fitted only to the timecourses of total FM B cell numbers and chimerism, we used them to predict the dynamics of Ki67 expression within host and donor cells over time. The best-fitting time-dependent homogeneous model  predicted these kinetics remarkably well. These predictions were generated by inserting the estimated rates of loss ($\delta(t) = \delta_{0} e^{-rt}$) and division ($\rho$) into a model which explicitly follows the transit of cells between \khi\ and \klo\ states, which we have employed previously (Hogan PNAS 2015, Gossel eLife 2017). We assumed a mean lifetime of Ki67 post-mitosis of 3.5d, and also assumed that \khi\ and \klo\ cells are lost at equal rates $\delta(t)$. The timecourses of host and donor \khi\ fractions were then generated by simulating the model with its best-fit parameters, beginning at the mean \khi\ fractions observed at 12d post-BMT, pooled across all experimental cohorts. See Methods below for details.

The simulations show that the host/donor disparity in Ki67 expression derives largely from residual expression of Ki67 on cells that have recently entered the FM pool from the T2 precursor population \red{T2s are not dividing, you say... so surely this is further evidence that T1s are the source for FMs?}.  Soon after BMT, the donor FM pool is highly enriched for these recent immigrants, roughly 80\% of which are Ki67,  relative to the more established host-derived pool. The lifetime of FM cells is relatively short and so a substantial fraction of newly immigrated \khi\ cells  are lost before they transition to \klo. This interplay means that quiescent donor cells are slow to accumulate. In parallel, Ki67 levels transiently dip in host FM cells following BMT due to the sudden reduction in influx from the host T2 pool, before they re-establish equilibrium at lower numbers. 

\subsection*{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most support for model in which FM B cell residence time increases with host age
\item No evidence for kinetic heterogeneity (\ie\ multiple subpopulations with different turnover, or host incumbents) 
\item No evidence for changes in the per-cell rate of differentiation from T2 with cell age
\item No evidence for changes in rates of loss or division of FM cells with cell age.
\end{itemize}

%of \khi\ fractions within host and donor compartments .
%The possible explanation for this is that majority of ki67 in FM compartment is source derived suggesting that FM cells are primarily maintained by high influx from source and by very low levels of cell division.
%The high influx corresponds to high loss rate (inverse of residence time, Table~\ref{tab:FM-parestm}) in the FM subset, which only allows for slow accumulation of \klo\ cells post BMT in the donor compartment. 
%Inflow of very high (> 90\% of donor influx) numbers of \khi\ cells with gradual accrual of \klo\ population, temporarily maintains high fractions of \khi\ cells within donor compartment, which slowly stabilise to levels equivalent to that of the host compartment as donor fractions stabilise.
%In the host compartment, since pre-existing cells are mostly \klo, the low inflow ($\chi \sim$ 0.8)  of new \khi\ cells doesnt alter the kinetics of \khi\ fractions within these cells.
%In summary, we find no strong evidence for heterogeneity within FM B cells which are suggested to be firmly regulated by the homeostatic factors changing with the age of the host.

\section*{Germinal Center B cells}

	\subsection*{Invasion kinetics of donor-derived GC cells differ between spleen and lymph nodes.}
	%Within the secondary lymphoid organs, naive and memory follicular B cells participate in  germinal center (GC) reactions which last for about 3 weeks [ref].
	GC cells are assumed to derive directly from the mature follicular cells [REF] which are known to circulate freely between spleen and lymph nodes [ref].
	Therefore, we use pooled numbers of spleen and LN FM cells as a common source for all GC B cell subsets.
	We find that in both spleen and lymph nodes, the chimerism in GC B cells  reaches the level of their source (Figure \ref{fig:results_GC} B), suggesting that the rules of replacement are identical for host and donor cells.
	Interestingly, the turnover of GC B cells in the spleen is more rapid than in lymph nodes, with the chimerism in spleen stabilising after approximately 120d  post-BMT, while it takes twice as long ($\sim$ 250d) in the lymph nodes.
	%In the spleen, the chimerism of spleen GC cells approaches that of  donor fractions stabilises close to 1 by about 120 days post BMT, while in the lymph nodes the replacement of host GC cells by that of donor-derived cells is relatively more gradual with normalised donor fractions reaching the asymptote values close to 1 by about 250 days.
	Due to this  disparity in the kinetics of infiltration of donor cells between the splenic and LN GC pools, we model them separately with an assumption that the same freely circulating pool of FM B cells feeds into both, spleen and LN GC populations with a constant rate of influx, over time. 
	
	\subsection*{B cells participating in GC reactions follow same kinetics of division and loss, irrespective of the age of the host.}
	We used the similar approach as that of FM cells and modelled the behaviour of \red{actively dividing and short-lived} GC B cells by allowing their net rate of loss $\lambda$ to vary with host-age. 
	The kinetics of cell counts and donor fractions in spleen and LN GC cells was described well visually by the model in which turnover $\delta$ varies with host-age, while varying the rate of cell division $\rho$ yields un-physiological parameter estimates when fitted to the data.
	Interestingly, we found that changes in $\delta$ with host age were extremely slow such that the time taken for the mean residence time of spleen and LN GC cells to double is 3900 and 2500 days, respectively.
	Therefore, at least up to 1 year of age (within the time-line of these experiments), we find no strong effect of age associated variations in the host environment on the turnover of B cells participating in GC reactions, in mice.
	
	
	Our analysis from the time-dependent model suggested that the population dynamics of GC B cells can be explained by rates of division and turnover that do not vary substantially with host age.
	So, we fitted the time-course of cell counts and donor fractions simultaneously using the simple model where the rate of net loss $\lambda$, which is the net effect of cell-division and loss, stays constant with host-age (Figure \ref{fig:results_GC} A and B).
	We find relatively stronger statistical support for the constant birth-death model, in both spleen and LN GC population, as compared to the model where $\lambda$ varies with host-age ($\Delta$ AIC = 2 and 3, respectively).
	Consistent with the disparity in donor fraction kinetics in spleen and lymph nodes, the mean life-time of a clonal lineage of LN GC B cells was estimated to be $\approx$ 3 fold longer than the spleen GC cells (15 and 41 days respectively, Table~\ref{tab:GC-parestm}).
	It can be inferred from this analysis that GC reactions have different half-lives between different secondary lymphoid organs and their dynamics are primarily regulated by the tissue-specific factors.
	%It also suggests that all the folicular cells participating in the GC reaction, behave identically at all times irespective of the age of the host.
	
	\subsection*{?No heterogeneity or weak heterogeneity?}
	Each instance of GC reaction lasts for about 3-4 weeks, which makes it highly unlikely for the turnover or division of GC B cells to be strongly influenced by the cell-intrinsic changes accumulated over such a short period of time.
	Additionally, rapid kinetics of inflation and collapse of GC clusters suggest that majority of GC cells may be short-lived with lifetimes much shorter than 3 weeks.
	Therefore, we refrained from using highly complex models of cell-age associated changes in either turnover or division of GC B cells.
	
	We explored the possibility that the GC B cell population is composed of kinetically heterogeneous subsets (as discussed in FM B cells section) but found that this model despite being over-parametrised and complex, does not improve on the fits from constant birth-death model (Table~\ref{tab:GC-AICs}).
	Additionally, we find no strong evidence for kinetic heterogeneity within the GC population using this model ($\lambda_1$ = 0.03(0.01, 0.07) and $\lambda_2$ = 0.09(0.03, 0.26) for spleen GC cells and $\lambda_1$ = 0.05(0.01, 0.23) and $\lambda_1$ = 0.02(0.01, 0.03) for LN GC cells).
	Alternatively, varying the rate with which follicular cells participate in GC reactions, while keeping the net cell loss constant also fails to capture the kinetics of cell counts and normalised donor fractions in spleen and LN GC populations ($\Delta$ AIC of 385 and 355 respectively).
	
	\red{I have fitted the age-structured model on GC cells and it fails to fit to LN GCs and show $\Delta$ AIC of 380 in spleen GCs.}
	
	We also addressed the possibility that host and donor cells may behave differently due to the presence of a persistent incumbent subset in the host compartment [Hogan et al PNAS 2015, Rane et al PLoS Bio 2018] that may arise during neonatal stages as the early waves of mature B cells begin to populate the periphery.
	The incumbent model fails to explain the GC B cell dynamics giving visually poor fits to the normalised donor fraction (not shown) and received lowest statistical support (Table~\ref{tab:GC-AICs}).
		
	
	\subsection*{Dynamics of ki67 expression in the actively dividing GC B cells.}
	As described earlier for the FM B cells, we used an additional validation strategy to test the robustness of the best-fitting model by comparing its predictions of the kinetics of \khi fractions for the GC B cell population to the observed data.
	We assumed that the \khi and \klo subsets are in the state of quasi-equilibrium, since the rate of change of source influx is much slower than the rate of loss of ki67 expression.
	This allowed us to infer the rates of turnover `$\delta$' and division `$\rho$' from the estimates of total net loss rate $\lambda$ obtained by fitting the constant birth-death model to the time-course of cell counts and normalised donor fractions in GC cells (detailed description in methods and Hogan et al. PNAS 2015).
	
	In both spleen and LN GC B cell populations, the fraction of \khi cells was continuously maintained high ($\sim$ 0.9), over a year post-BMT.
	We found that the best-fitting constant birth-death model predicts this trend extremely well for donor and host compartments in both tissues ( Figure~\ref{fig:results_GC} C).
	To amke these predictions we asumed that the mean lifetime of ki67 expression post mitosis was 3.5d and also considered that \khi cells die or differentiate at an equal rate as that of \klo cells.
	Majority of the follicular cells participating in GC reactions have low ki67 expression (\khi fraction in FM $\approxeq$ 0.1), suggesting that almost all of the GC cells undergo multiple rounds of cell-division or are lost from the pool rapidly before losing ki67 expression or both. 
	
	 
	\subsection*{Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Gc cell dynamics vary between spleen and lymph nodes, as seen by slower replacement kinetics and longer clonal life-times of LN GC cells.
		
		\item Simple homogeneous model with constant lambda successfully ecplains GC cell dynamics.
		This may suggests that under the influence of very strong antigen derived signals the mean inter-division and residence times of all cells within the GC pool, remain constant across different instances of germinal center reactions, over time.
		The strong signals from antigen and Th cells washes out the heterogeneity between GC cell precursors?
		This is particularly intersting since there are reports of dark and light zones in GC reactions that are apparent roughly around 10days of GC lifetime. Could be the result of delayed division due to selection and affinity maturation events?
		I am not sure if we are capturing true GC dynamics here.
		
		\item Ki67 in GC is result of active division and turnover and is not source derived. FM population has 15\% \khi cells while GC are $\sim$ 95\% \khi.

\section*{Predicting the kinetics of Ki67 expression in host and donor FM cells}

We divide host and donor FM cells into recently divided (\khi) and quiscent (\klo) compartments (Figure~\label{fig:Ki67schematic}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale = 0.5] {TwoComp_ki67.pdf}}
	\caption{Two compartment model for prolifeartion and loss of B cells using Ki67 as a marker for dividing and recently divided cells \label{fig:Ki67schematic}}
\end{figure}

This system is represented by the following coupled ordinary differential equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dY^+}{dt} &= \epsilon \phi(t)  + \rho \, (2\, Y^- + Y^+) - \beta Y^+ - \sigma \delta Y^+ ,\\
\frac{dY^-}{dt} &=  (1-\epsilon) \phi(t) - \rho Y^-  + \beta Y^+ - \delta  Y^+.
\end{aligned}
\label{general_ode}
\end{eqnarray}

Here,
\begin{itemize}
\item $\epsilon$ denotes the proportion of the cells entering from T2  that are \khi. Estimated from the data ($\simeq 0.8$).
\item $\chi(t)$ is the time-varying chimerism of the source, estimated from the data and averaged over all mice.
\item $\delta$ is the rate of loss (death + maturation) of \klo\ cells.
\item In general it is possible that recently-divided \khi\ cells may have different susceptibility to loss than quiescent (\klo) cells. The parameter $\sigma$ is the relative loss rate of \khi\ and \klo\ cells. In the simulations we ran we assumed $\sigma=1$.
\item $\rho$ is the rate of entry into division for both \klo\ and \khi\ cells. The mean interdivision time is $1/\rho$.
\item $\beta$ is the rate of loss of Ki67 expression after mitosis.  We and others  have estimated the mean expression time $\frac{1}{\beta}$  to be 3.5 days. 
\end{itemize}

The quantities $\phi$ and  $\chi(t)$,  are obtained from splines fitted to the numbers of host and donor cells in the source populations, and $\delta(t)$ and $\rho$ come from the fits to cell counts and donor fractions within FM. The influx from the source population (T2) changes very slowly relative to the rates of flow between \khi\ to \klo\ and so we assume that these populations (Y$^+$ and Y$^-$) are in quasi-equilibrium. \red{(This means they are locked into the kinetics of the source population and don't slosh around as the influx is changing. Think about being able to keep your balance standing on a moving train -- if it's not too jerky you can keep stably upright because the timescale over which your muscles can respond is pretty quick. If the train accelerates or decelerates fast, you will respond by lurching around a bit before you regain equilibrium)}.  We then solve the equations above with initial numbers of \klo\ and \khi\ host and donor cells taken from the experimental obervations at $t_{0}$ = 21 days post BMT.  We solve them twice -- once for host cells with influx $\phi(t) (1 -\chi(t))$, and again for donor cells with influx $\phi(t) \chi(t)$. We then calculate the predicted \khi\ proportions $Y^{+}/(Y^{+} + Y^{-})$ in host and donor cells over time.

\textbf{Mathematical models used to describe B cell population dynamics}
\paragraph*{Constant birth-death model:}
\textit{All cells behave identically at all times.} \\
In this model we assume that cells follow random birth-death processes to form a kinetically homogeneous population that self renews through homeostatic division and decays either by death or maturation. 
Per capita net loss rate `$\lambda$' is given by loss - proliferation ($\delta - \rho$)  and is assumed to be constant over time. \\
Abbereviated as CBDM

\be
\frac{dN}{dt} = \phi[t] \, - \lambda \, N(t)
\label{eq:SHM}
\ee

\paragraph*{Time-dependent model:} 
\textit{All cells behave identically at a given instant of time.} \\
This is also a homogeneous model where all cells obey the same rules of turnover. We assume that the fitness of the whole population changes over time/host-age, due to host-intrisic factors. 
The net loss rate $\lambda$ varies with time. We explored different forms of lambda changing with time and the best-fit was obtained with the very general form representing slow exponential decline in $\lambda$ with host age, $\lambda(t) = \lambda_0 \, e^{-r\,t}$.
Abbereviated as TDM

\be
\frac{dN}{dt} = \phi[t] \, - \lambda(t) \, N(t)
\label{eq:TDM}
\ee


\paragraph*{Age-structured model:} 
\textit{This is a heterogeneous model} \\
In this model the ability of individual cells to die or divide varies with their cell-age. 
The net loss rate $\lambda$ is a function of cell's age in the current lineage. 
Changes in fitness of individual cells with age could arise as a result of adaptive changes in cell-intrisic factors and/or conditioning that cells receive through micro-environmental inteactions (host intrisic factors) throughot their lifetime.
We explored different forms of $\lambda(a)$ changing with cell age and the best-fit was obtained by, $\lambda(a) = \lambda_0 \, e^{-r \,a} $.
The PDE described in eq.~\ref{eq:ASM} tracks the population dynamics of $N(a,t)$ over time.
We also assume that the fitness of individual cells is inherited by their daughter cells.
Abbereviated as ASM

\be
\frac{\partial{N(a,t)}}{\partial{a}} + \frac{\partial{N(a,t)}}{\partial{t}} = - \lambda(a) N(a,t),
\label{eq:ASM}
\ee

We solved Equation~\ref{eq:ASM} by the method of characteristics and using two boundary conditions. One is the constraint that the population density of cells of post-thymic age $a=0$, $N(t,0)$, at any time $t$  is simply the rate of source influx at that moment, $\phi(t)$. The second boundary condition is the population density with respect to cell age at time zero, $N(0,a) = g(a)$. We can then track both (i) the fate of the population present at time zero, $N_\text{init}(t,a)$,  and (ii) the fates of cells subsequently matured from T2 cells, $N_\phi(t,a)$;
\be
\begin{aligned} 
	N_\text{init}(t,a) &= g(a-t) \exp \bigg( - \int_0^t \lambda(\tau + a - t) \, d\tau \bigg), \, \text{for} \, a \ge t \\ 
	N_phi(t,a) &= phi(t-a) \exp \bigg (- \int_0^a \lambda(\tau) \, d\tau \bigg), \, \text{for}  \, a \le t \\ 
\end{aligned} 
\label{fig:PDEsolution}
\ee 
We consider three subsets: The host population generated pre-BMT $N_\text{init}^h (t,a)$, the host population post-BMT $N_phi^h (t,a)$, and the donor population post-BMT $N_phi^d (t,a)$. We add these subsets and integrate over cell age to obtain total cell counts.
\be
N_\text{total}(t) = \int_0^t \left ( N_\text{init}^h (t,a) + N_{\phi}^h (t,a)+ N_{\phi}^d (t, a) \right ) \, da 
\ee

We used the exponential ($\lambda(a) = \lambda_0 \, e^{-a/r}$) form for the net loss rate $\lambda$ decreasing with cell age. The population density of B cells with respect to cell age at time zero is unknown and we model it as $ g(a) = \, e^{p a} \, \phi_0 $. The free parameter $p$ can be positive or negative, such that older cells can initially be over- or under-represented compared to younger cells. This definition of $g(a)$ also ensures, for consistency, that $g(0)$ is the rate of influx at t0, $\phi_{0}$.  This quantity is unknown but can be expressed in terms of $g(a)$ and the initial pool size  $N_0$;
\be
\text{Total cell numbers} = \int_0^{t_0} g(a) \, da = \int_0^{t_0} e^{p a} \, \phi_0 \, da= N_{0} \implies   \phi_0 = \frac{N_{0} p}{e^{\,p \,t_a}-1} ,
\ee 
where the range of possible cell ages at host age $t_{0}$ is $0 \le a \le t_{0}$. 

Busulfan treatment results in  levels of chimerism that vary slightly across mice. To compare replacement across mice, we normalised the  fraction of cells in the periphery that were donor-derived to the chimerism in source compartment $\chi$.
\be
\text{Normalised donor fraction} \; f_{d} = \frac{N^d_{\phi}(t)} {\chi \, N_\text{total}(t)} \\
\ee 
To incorporate data from bone marrow transfers made in recipients with different ages, we tracked the changes in the numbers of (i) the cells present at $t_0$, until the host's age at BMT ($t_b$), which were present with age distribution $g(a)$ at time $t_{0}$; and (ii) the cells matured from T2 between $t_0$ and BMT. 
\be
\begin{aligned} 
	G(a) =\,\, & \left\{ 
	\begin{aligned} 
		&g(a-(t_b-t_0)) \,\, e^{\int_{0}^{t-t_0} \lambda(\tau) d\tau} \quad \quad \qquad a \geq t_b-t_0\ \\ 
		&\phi(t_b-t_0-a) \,\, e^{\int_{0}^{a} \lambda(\tau) d\tau} \quad \,\, \quad \quad \qquad a \le t_b-t_0\ 
	\end{aligned} 
	\right\} \\ 
\end{aligned} 
\\
\ee
The cell-age distribution at BMT  is therefore a composite function $G(a)$ that tracks the cells with age distribution $g(a)$ at the age of the mice with the earliest BMT, and also those cells exported from the thymus until the age of BMT. The model can therefore accommodate differences between mice in their age at BMT. Best-fit values of the unknown parameters - $N(0)$, $p$, $\lambda_0$, and $r$ were obtained by simultaneously fitting to the log-transformed cell counts and untransformed normalised donor fractions, in {\it R} using  the Nelder-Mead algorithm.


\paragraph{Incumbent model:}
\textit{This is also a heterogeneous model} \\
 The incumbent model (Hogan et al. 2015) considers that a B cell poulation is composed of kinetically distinct subpopulations - (i) an incumbent subset of older, self-renewing cells that are resistant to displacement by new cells and (ii) a displaceble subset that turns over with a constant rate `$\lambda$' and is replaced continuously by cohorts of new cells entering the pool.
 
\be
\begin{aligned}
 &\frac{dN_{\text{donor}}}{dt} = \chi \, \phi_0 \, e^{-\nu t} - \lambda \, N_{\text{donor}}(t) \\
 &\frac{dN_{\text{host}}}{dt} = (1-\chi) \, \phi_0 \, e^{-\nu t} - \lambda \, N_{\text{host}}(t)\\
 &\frac{dI}{dt}   = -\lambda_i I(t) 
\end{aligned}
\ee
 
As described in (Hogan et al. 2015), we solved these ODEs  to obtain total cell counts $N(t)$, with initial condition $N(0) - I(0) = N_{\text{donor}}(0) + N_{\text{host}}(0)$, where $N_{\text{donor}}(0)$, $N_{\text{host}}(0)$ and $I(0)$ are the numbers of donor, host and incumbent cells present at $t_0$, respectively. We accounted for different ages at BMT,  by tracking changes in initial donor population $N_{\text{donor}}(0)$ at different recipient ages. The initial cell counts and normalised donor fraction at the given age of BMT are then
\be
\begin{aligned}
&N(t_b) = \frac{\phi(t-t_0) \, \, (e^{(\lambda - \nu) (t_b-t_0)} - 1) + (\lambda-\nu) \, (N(0)-I(0)) + (\lambda-\nu) \, \, I(0) \, e^{(\lambda - \lambda_i) (t_b-t_0)}} {(\lambda-\nu) \,\, e^{\lambda (t_b-t_0)}} \\
\\
&f_d(t_b) = \frac{N(0) \,f_d(0) \, e^{-\nu (t_b-t_0)} }{N(t_b)}
\end{aligned}
\ee
and the total cell counts and normalised donor fraction as functions of host age are
\be
\begin{aligned}
&N(t) = \frac{\phi(t-t_0) \, \, e^{-\nu(t_b-t_0)} \, \,  (e^{(\lambda - \nu) (t-t_b)} - 1) + (\lambda-\nu) \, (N(t_b)-I(t_b)) + (\lambda-\nu) \, \, I(t_b) \, e^{(\lambda - \lambda_i) (t-t_b)}} {(\lambda-\nu) \,\, e^{\lambda (t-t_b)}}\\
\\
&f_d(t) = \frac{\phi(t-t_0) \, \, e^{-\nu(t_b-t_0)} \, \, (e^{(\lambda - \nu) (t-t_b)} - 1) + (\lambda-\nu) \,  N(t_b) \, f_d(t_b)}{ \phi(t-t_0) \, \, (e^{(\lambda - \nu) (t-t_b)} - 1) + (\lambda-\nu) \, (N(t_b)-I(t_b)) + (\lambda-\nu) \,\, I(t_b) \, e^{(\lambda -\lambda_i) \, (t-t_b)}}
\end{aligned}
\ee

The incumbent model has four free parameters ($N(0)$, $\phi_0$, $I(0)$ and $\lambda$) when fitted from t0 (the age of youngest animal at BMT) since fd(0) = 0.

\section*{Appendix}
\section*{Modelling chimerism dynamics in the source compartment}
In order to compare the inflitartion of donor cells into the FM pool across all animals that have varying levels of chimerism in their bone marrow cell populations, we normalise the fraction of donor cells in FM pool by dividing with the value of chimerism `$\chi$' in their immediate source i.e. T2 compartment.
Therefore the quantity, normalised donor fraction $f_{d}$, is independent of chimerism and is only sensitive to parameters that are common across animals.
We describe the changes in chimerism over time using a phenomenological function (equation~\ref{eq:chimerism})  that reasonably depicts the shape of the timecourse of fraction of donor cells across all animals.

\be
\chi(t) = \chi_{stable} \, (1 - e^{-q \,t}) 
\label{eq:chimerism}
\ee

Parameters `$\chi_{stable}$' and `q' are estimated by fitting the spline in equation~\ref{eq:chimerism} to the observed donor fractions in T2 compartment.


\section*{Modelling Source influx}
We assumed that the rate of influx from source $\psi$, stays constant and used the cell counts of Transitional 2 (T2) compartment as a proxy to estimate the number of cells maturing into the FM pool.  
Equation~\ref{eq:source}, is a spline that is used to describes the changes in T2 cells over time. 
Parameters $S_0$ and $\nu$ are estimated by fitting the spline in equation~\ref{eq:source} to the observed cell counts of T2 compartment.

\be
S(t) = S_0 \, e^{-\nu \, t}
\label{eq:source}
\ee
The counts of total, donor and host T2 cells entering the FM pool at any instant is given by equation~\ref{eq:influx}. The rate constant $\psi$ is estimated using model fits to cell counts and donor fractions.
\bea
\begin{aligned}
&\phi(t) = \psi \, S(t) \\
&\phi_{\text{donor}}(t) = \psi \, S(t) \, \chi(t)   \\
&\phi_{\text{host}}(t) = \phi(t) - \phi_{\text{donor}}(t) 
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:influx}
\eea
