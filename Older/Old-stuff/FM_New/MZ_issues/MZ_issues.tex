\title{Issues with MZ model fits and ki67 predictions}

\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{T2 as the source} : The kinetics of total cell counts and normalised donor frations (f$_\text{d}$) of MZ cells are best exlplained by the age-structured model ($\Delta \text{AIC} = 3$, Table~\ref{tab:MZs_extended}, also Figure\ref{fig:ASM_MZ} A).
	Fails to explain the timecourse of \khi fractions (Figure\ref{fig:ASM_MZ} B).
	
	\item \textbf{T1 as the source} : Most support for the time-dependent model ($\Delta \text{AIC} = 9$, Table~\ref{tab:MZs_extended}, also Figure\ref{fig:TDM_MZ} A).
	Also, fails to explain the timecourse of \khi fractions (Figure\ref{fig:TDM_MZ} B).
	
	\item All the other models followed the same trend $\rightarrow$ Failed to capture the kinetics of \khi fractions using parameters estimated from the fits to cell counts and f$_\text{d}$.
	
	\item Varying the rate of source influx in all the models mentioned in table~\ref{tab:MZs_extended}, does not improve their ability to predict the kinetics of \khi fractions.
	
	\item We tried combination of different models. The hybrid models were over-parametrised (the algorithm that we use to fit models may run into problems for more than 5 unknown parameters). Therefore, we decided to run simulations of cell counts, f$_\text{d}$ and ki67 kinetics and fixed some of the parameters before fitting these models to the data.
	
	\item The time-dependent + incumbent combination shows the best compromise between model fits to the cell counts and f$_\text{d}$ and the predictions of \khi fractions (Figure~\ref{fig:TDM_INC_MZ} A and B). These fits were generated using T2 as the source and the rate of source influx was fixed based on the simulations. I also had to assume that the fraction of \khi cells in source influx `$\epsilon$' to be 1 in order to generate ki67 predictions.
	
	\item We are not happy with these fits and hence trying few other models. Since, cell counts of MZ cells seem to be tightly regulated, tried density-dependent model $\rightarrow$ didn't work. Currently, testing density-dependent model in combination with other models. No luck so far.
	
	\item Melissa provided some interesting information about age-associated B cells (ABCs) contaminating the MZ compartment. This might explain all the troubles we are facing with MZ cells. 
	
	\item If there is a contaminating population of ABCs with different dynamics in the MZ compartment then the kinetic heterogeneity (KH) model should be able to explain the data. However, KH model fails to capture the trend in ki67 $\rightarrow$ probably because of the time-dependent kinetics of accumulation of ABCs at the marginal zone. I think ABCs are folicular cells that lose their complement receptor (CD21) expression (probably due to exhaustion) and migrate to the marginal zone since they cant compete for folicular retention without CD21. [Michael caroll, Seminars in Imm. August 1998]
	
	\item The time-dependent effects in \khi fractions in the donor MZ population can be explained by gradual migration of \klo ABCs into the MZ pool. The big assumption here is that MZ cells have high \khi fractions due to frequent divisions. 
	
	
\end{itemize}
